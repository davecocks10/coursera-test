              <p>
                  In the UK and Ireland adult male chickens over the age of 12 months are primarily known as cocks, whereas in America, Australia and Canada they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than 1 year old are cockerels. Castrated roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as hens and younger females as pullets although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook /ˈtʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes. The young are called chicks and the meat is called chicken.  In some breeds the adult rooster can be distinguished from the hen by his larger comb"Chicken" originally referred to chicks, not the species itself. The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).  In the Deep South of the United States chickens are also referred to by the slang term yardbird.

              <p>
                  Beef is raised and/or eaten in most countries of the world. It’s price and frequency of consumption varies depending on availability. In the US it is readily available and relatively cheap; this is why we eat quite a bit. In other parts of the world like Japan it is difficult to raise due to limited space so it eaten less often and is very expensive.During butchering each animal is divided into large “chunks” called primals. In butcher shops and some high-end restaurants you will find personnel who can butcher a whole side of beef. But in today’s supermarkets you will find people called meat cutters who do not cut beef from the side. They only break down beef from these large primal cuts into fabricated cuts that are sold at the retail level. Each primal yields specific market cuts.As animals move about in the field they exercise their muscles, on a beef the front shoulder area gets a lot of muscle activity. The rear of the animal also gets a lot of movement, but since they walk around forward the front gets more. The most muscle development and consequently the toughest meats, happens in the front legs of the beef. The amount of fat accumulation (which is certainly related to how much activity an animal has had and the type of feed they have been given) determines the grade the animal achieves. The grade determines the price per pound of the animal. The picture shows a piece of Kobe beef with tremendous marbling.

              <p>
                  Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients (ねた, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).The inventor of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period (1603–1867). It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat.
